In previous repository, I challenged my first socke.io project.
And in this repository, I challenged Socket.io project with React.js.

This project is alost not fancy.
But, it is good content for me to understand how to use socket.io in frontend and backend.

This is very simple project. 
So, I do not deploy demosite.

### Env Variables (.env)

"PORT": "your port here" <br/>

Thank you for reading.
And, happy coding!!
